thread-safe concurrent map written by go


## Features

- Simple implementation for concurrent map
- Very light-weight, just a `.go` file!


## Install

```
go get github.com/AaronWharton/comap
```


## Comments

This project is only for golang internal implementation learning, now that golang official has released golang 1.9 beta, and concurrent map is supported, this project will be no longer updated. But problem discussion is welcome.
